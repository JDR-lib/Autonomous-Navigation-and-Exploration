## Autonomous-Navigation-and-Exploration

This  project  report  deals  with  work  donefor  implementing  and  testing  different  highlevel  con-trollers  for  path  planning  algorithms  in  a  simulated  en-vironment. The work is done in a simulated environmentand  the  task  of  autonomous  navigation  in  an  unknown environment  is  projected.  The  project  is  divided  intotwo  parts  ,  the  first  step  is  to  navigate  in  an  unknown environment  for  certain  time  to  create  a  map  of  theplaced  system.  The  second  step  is  to  return  back  to  the home position from any point the exploration is stopped.
